# Build and deploy

## Create a JS bundle

```bash
    yarn build
```

That's it.

## Deploy

Copy the build directory contents to the Web Server of your choice.

## Deploy on a subpath

Change the `homepage` value of the `package.json` file to match the full deployment path of the website and rebuild the project.
